How to use:
Copy the contents of the repository inside arduino/hardware/libraries/ColorLCD. Open the sketch in the "examples" directory for an example. Check ColorLCD.h for a list of public functions.

Have fun!

Note: The Nokia 6100/6610/etc display clones are supposed to use either a Philips PCF8833 controller, or an Epson S1D15G10 controller. I bought my display from eBay and I'm not sure which controller does it use because it doesn't seem to work exactly like one of those two. Maybe the controller itself is a clone. In any case, this is the code that works for me. If it doesn't work for you, contact me.

Version 0.2.0 (dev version : February 1, 2010 - present)
Current development version. Change log from version 0.1.1:
* !!inverted the comm pins order, please modify the wiring or source code
* some code refactoring
* all screen areas are now specified as x, y, width, height. Some of them were x1, y1, x2, y2 before.
* fixed a bug that could cause misalignment of text output with the vertical margins
* added the option to print a single zoomed in character. Considering this just prints a resized bitmap, it's very low quality so you might be better off displaying bitmaps

Version 0.1.1 (dev version: Dec 28, 2009 - January 31, 2010)
This is the old development version. Change log from version 0.1:
* replaced the loop used for bit banging with a sequential structure; reset() now takes only 111 milliseconds instead of 183
* it doesn't hold the font bitmaps in ram, it loads them from flash when needed. This saves about 500 bytes of RAM, and it seems it isn't slower.
* fixed a bug in colorFill() that caused the last pixel in the selection to keep its previous color if the last operation was a colorFill() on an overlapping selection
* added a new example, a voltmeter implementation using the ADC

Version 0.1 (Dec 28, 2009)
First release. At the moment, this library allows you to display text, rectangles and bitmaps. Most of the development has been focused on making text output as powerful and simple as possible. It is very similar with using the serial port from the built-in Arduino library.
